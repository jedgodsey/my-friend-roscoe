### User Stories

Your app must:
* **HAVE ITS OWN REPO, under your github account. NOT A FORK.**
* **Git 20+ commits** Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed.
* **Include Wireframes and User Stories in the README** 
* **Wireframe:** - Basically draw out what your game will look likeâ€”very different way it could look. You can use paper or any wireframe tool you find online.
* **User Stories** - Wording should center around how a user interacts with your game, for example:
    1.  The user click starts and the level starts
    2.  When the user hits the ```f key``` a fire ball is catuplulated at a target. 
* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **JavaScript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it (we will show you how)
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
* Be reasonably complex
